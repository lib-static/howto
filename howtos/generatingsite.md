Generating your website code in your text editor allows you to see your edits as you make them, BEFORE you publish your edits.

### Step 1: Open your Repository in your Text Editor

- View this [guide](openrepointexteditor.html) if you're unsure how to do this.

### Step 2: Open your Terminal in your Text Editor

- View this [guide](openterminalwindows.html) if you're unsure how to do this.

### Step 3: Type `jekyll s` into your terminal

- This is a command working with jekyll to act a local server for your website.
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="/github/jekylls.png" caption="Locally serving your website" alt="Typing jekyll s into the terminal to locally serve your website" %}

### Step 4: View your Website

- Give it a few seconds and it will generate a link.
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="/github/jekyllslink.png" caption="Local link for your website" alt="a screenshot of the link for your website" %}

- Hold down the `ctrl` button and click on this link and it will open in your browser.

Now you can see your edits as you make them in your text editor! You don't need to push your changes before viewing them now.

- You will have to save all of your changes and refresh your page before seeing further edits.

### To Stop Serving your Website...

- If you want to serve another website or if you want to close your programs you will have to stop locally serving your website.

- To do this, go back into your terminal and press `ctrl + c`
