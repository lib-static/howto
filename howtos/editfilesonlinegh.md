title: How To Edit Files in GitHub Online
---

### Step 1: Log In to Your [GitHub Account](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}

- Select the file you would like to edit. If you [created a new repository](setupgithubrepo.html.) and initialized it with a README file, you can start by editing this file to get the hang of things.

### Step 2: Select the Edit Button

- The edit button is marked by a pencil icon on the top left side of the file.

- Locate that and select it for the file you'd like to edit.

### Step 3: Commit your Changes

- Once you've made your desired changes, scroll to the bottom of the page to the "Commit Changes" box.

- In the first box, you would type a sort of title describing the changes you just made. This way, it's easier to keep track of the changes you have made and undo them later, if necessary.

- The second box is a way to further describe your change, but it is optional.

- After you've described your changes, commit your change by selecting the "Commit Changes" button.
