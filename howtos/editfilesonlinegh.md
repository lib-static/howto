title: How To Edit Files in GitHub Online
---

### Step 1: Sign in to your [GitHub Account](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}

- Select the file you would like to edit

  - If you [created a new repository](setupgithubrepo.html.) and initialized it with a README file, you can get the hang of things by editing that file first 

### Step 2: Select the "Edit" button

- The edit button is marked by a pencil icon on the top right-hand side of the file

- Make the desired changes to your file

### Step 3: Describe your changes

- After editing your file, scroll to the bottom of the page to the "Commit Changes" section

- Type a brief title describing the changes you just made in the first text box

  - This description helps you keep track of the changes and undo them later, if necessary

- If necessary, use the optional second text box to add a more detailed description
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="/github/github_commitchangeonline.png" caption="Describing and committing your changes" alt="Describing and committing your changes" %}

### Step 4: Commit your changes

- After describing your changes, commit them by selecting "Commit Changes"

  - In GitHub, the word "commit" is similar to the word "save"
