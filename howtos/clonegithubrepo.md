title: How To Clone a Repository in GitHub
---

This guide will help you clone a repository from your online GitHub account to GitHub desktop. Cloning a repository allows you to edit and create website code within a text editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](visualstudiocode.html){:target="_blank"} or [Atom](installatom.html){:target="_blank"}. This will also download your website code files locally on your computer.

### Step 4: That's It!!

You've successfully cloned your repository and should be able to see your repository name in the top left corner of GitHub desktop. For additional help, you can refer to [GitHub's guides.](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects){:target="_blank"}

Now you're able to [open and edit the code](openrepointexteditor.html) in text editors such as [Visual Studio Code](visualstudiocode.html){:target="_blank"} and [Atom](installatom.html){:target="_blank"}. You can also refer to [this guide](pushpullchanges.html) to help you understand [pushing and pulling commits](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project){:target="_blank"} to your GitHub online.
