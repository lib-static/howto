title: How To Clone a Repository in GitHub
---

This guide will help you to clone a repository from you GitHub account to GitHub desktop. This will allow you to work with your website code with a text editor such as [Visual Studio Code](visualstudiocode.html){:target="_blank"} or [Atom](installatom.html){:target="_blank"}. It will also download your website code files locally on your computer.

You've successfully cloned you repository to GitHub desktop. In your GitHub desktop, you should be able to see your repository name on the top left corner. For additional help, you can refer to [GitHub's guides.](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects){:target="_blank"}

From here, you're able to [open and edit the code](openrepointexteditor.html) in text editors such as [Visual Studio Code](visualstudiocode.html){:target="_blank"} and [Atom](installatom.html){:target="_blank"}. You can also refer to [this guide](pushpullchanges.html) to help you understand [pushing and pulling commits](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project){:target="_blank"} to your GitHub online.
