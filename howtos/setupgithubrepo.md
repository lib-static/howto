This guide will show you how to create a repository in your online GitHub account.

Each repository is like a folder of files for one project that will be tracked together. For example, a CollectionBuilder project will be one repository.

### Step 1: Sign in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} account

### Step 2: Create a new repository in GitHub
There are a few different ways to make a new repository depending on which page you are on.

You can begin creating a new repository in GitHub by:
- Selecting the green "New" button

- Clicking the plus icon at the top right corner of the page and selecting “New Repository”
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="/github/github_newrepository.png" caption="Two ways to create a new repository" alt="Two ways to create a new repository in GitHub online" %}

### Step 3: Name and describe your repository

After selecting "create a new repository", the next page will prompt you to enter more information.

- Fill in the "Repository name" field with a name that reflects the repository or collection you wish to create

- If necessary, use the optional "Description" field to share more information about your repository
  - This field is helpful if you're collaborating with others

{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="/github/github_newdescription.png" caption="Giving your repository a name" alt="Repository name and description fields" %}

### Step 4: README and .gitignore

- Scroll down the page to the "Skip this step if you’re importing an existing repository" section

- Check the box next to "Initialize this repository with a README"
  - This will create your repository with at least one document that you can edit, making it easier to get started
  
- Select the "Add .gitignore" dropdown box, start typing "Jekyll" in the search, then select the "Jekyll" option

{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="/github/github_readme.png" caption="Selecting the README box, adding the Jekyll .gitignore, and creating your repository. " alt="Checked README box, added Jekyll .gitignore, and creating the repository" %}

### Step 5: Select the "Create Repository" button
Awesome! You successfully created a repository.

### Step 6: Use your new repository to create your own CollectionBuilder page

Now you are able to use this repository to:
- Create your own [GitHub page](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)

- Create your own [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/){:target="_blank"} page

Follow this ["how-to"](githubdesktoprepo.html){:target="_blank"} to set up CollectionBuilder in your repository.

{:.alert .alert-info}
Before you set up CollectionBuilder in your repository, you will need to install [GitHub Desktop](githubdesktop.html){:target="_blank"} and a text editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](visualstudiocode.html){:target="_blank"} or [Atom](installatom.html){:target="_blank"}.
