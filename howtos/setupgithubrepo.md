title: How To Create a New GitHub Repository
---

This guide will show you how to create a repository in your online GitHub account.
Think of each repository as a folder of files for one project that will be tracked together. 
For example, a CollectionBuilder project will be one repository.

### Step 1: Create a New Repository in GitHub

1. Login to [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}.
2. Make a new repository. There are a few different ways to make a new repository depending on what page you are on:

- You can create a new repository in GitHub by selecting the green "New" button whenever you see that. Or you can go to the top right corner and click the plus icon and select “New Repository” on any page within GitHub.

### Step 2: Name and Describe Your Repository

- After selecting to create a new repository, you will be brought to a page prompting you to enter the details for your new repository. Fill in the first field "Repository Name" with a name fitting to the repository or collection you wish to create.
- Then fill in the second field asking for a description of your repository. It is optional, but it is helpful if collaborating with others.

### Step 3: README and .gitignore

- Scroll down the page from where you named your repository. There will be a checkbox next to "Initialize this repository with a README". Check this box. This will start your repository with at least one document that you can edit, making it easier to get started.
- Directly under the README checkbox, there will be a dropdown list button saying "Add .gitignore". Click the dropdown, start typing "Jekyll" in the search, and select the "Jekyll" option.
- The rest of the settings should be ready to go as they are. Now select the "Create Repository" button.

### Step 4: Use Your New Repository to create your own CollectionBuilder page!

- Awesome! You successfully created a repository. Now you are able to use this to create your own [GitHub page](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) OR you can now create your own [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/){:target="_blank"} page!
- Follow this ["How To"](githubdesktoprepo.html){:target="_blank"} to set up the CollectionBuilder repository into your own.

Before you set up CollectionBuilder in your repository, you will have to install [GitHub Desktop](githubdesktop.html){:target="_blank"} and a text editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](visualstudiocode.html){:target="_blank"}.
