title: How To Open a Terminal
---

The terminal or command line is a text-based interface for efficiently getting stuff done. 
It's often called the shell, terminal, console, cmd, or Bash, but ultimately the **Shell** is simply a program on your computer like any other application. 

Its job is to act as a **command shell**, taking input from the user, ordering the computer's operating system (OS) to execute the instructions, and returning the outputs.

The most popular and commonly used is the Unix shell **Bash** ([Bourne Again SHell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))) which is standard on Linux and Mac OS, and available on Windows via [Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) or [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

To open a terminal: 

- Windows
  - Select the Windows menu and search for "Git Bash"
- Mac
  - Navigate to the "Terminal" app via Applications > Utilities or lauch Spotlight (`Command + spacebar`) and type "Terminal"
- Linux
  - Most likely called "Terminal"

Most operating systems also allow you to open a terminal in a specific file location by right-clicking on a folder and selecting "Open in Terminal" or "Git Bash Here".
