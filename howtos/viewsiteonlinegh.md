- You can copy this link, and then paste it into your site description on the "code" tab. 
1. Navigate back to your site files by selecting the "code" tab.
2. Select the "edit" button on the right-hand side next to your site description.
3. Paste the link that appeared when you published your website under the "settings" tab.
