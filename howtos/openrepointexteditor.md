title: How To Open Your Repository in a Text Editor
---

{:.alert .alert-warning}
Before starting this how-to guide, you should already have a [GitHub account](setupgithubaccount.html){:target="_blank"} and have [GitHub desktop](githubdesktop.html){:target="_blank"} and a text editor (such as [Visual Studio Code](visualstudiocode.html){:target="_blank"} or [Atom](installatom.html){:target="_blank"}) installed on your computer.

This guide will help you open your repository in a text editor such as Visual Studio Code or Atom. From here you can edit the code for your website and ["commit" your changes to GitHub](pushpullchanges.html){:target="_blank"}.

### Step 1: Open GitHub desktop

- Under "Current Repository", select the repository you want to edit
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="/github/github_currentrepository.png" caption="Current repository on GitHub desktop" alt="screen shot of the download button" %}

### Step 2: Open repository in Text Editor

- On the GitHub Desktop menu, select the "Repository" tab

- Then select the option that says "Open in Text Editor", "Open in Visual Studio Code", or the name of another text editor

{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="/github/github_openinvisualstudiocode.png" caption="Opening repository in text editor" alt="screen shot of opening repository in text editor" %}

{:.alert .alert-success}
That's it! Your repository files and code should now be open within your text editor.
