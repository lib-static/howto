title: How To Open Your Repository in a Text Editor
---

{:.alert .alert-warning}
You should already have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} before proceeding with this How To. You should also have [GitHub desktop](githubdesktop.html){:target="_blank"} and a text editor such as [Visual Studio Code](visualstudiocode.html){:target="_blank"} or [Atom](installatom.html){:target="_blank"} installed your computer.

This guide will help you open your repository in a text editor such as Visual Studio Code or Atom. From here you can edit your code for your website as it is connected through GitHub and GitHub desktop.

### Step 1: Open your GitHub desktop

- Make sure the repository you want to edit is selected under your "Current Repository".

### Step 2: Open in Text Editor

1. On the top menu of GitHub Desktop, select the "Repository" tab.
2. Then select the option that says "Open in Text Editor"
    - It might also say "Open in Visual Studio Code" if that is the text editor you have. Same goes for if you have any other text editor already.
