[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/){:target="_blank"} is a fairly young and developing programming language with some unique features. 
To use Jekyll, ***you do not need to know anything about Ruby***, but if you are curious, check out [Ruby in 20 minutes](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/){:target="_blank"}.
Jekyll requires Ruby version 2.4.0 or above (at the time of this writing), plus a few common build tools. 
Check the [Jekyll requirements](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/){:target="_blank"} for latest details.

Installing Ruby on Mac can be a PAIN IN THE ASS. Stick with it! We detail several different trouble shooting techniques below, but if you run into other issues, please let us know and we can update this guide with more warnings and (hopefully) solutions. Also, make sure to follow steps 1 and 2!

1. Make yourself a beverage of some sort, adult or otherwise. We recommend a [Terminal Gravity Eagle Cap IPA](https://terminalgravitybrewing.com/eagle-cap){:target="_blank"} if you're in the Northwest, or a [Bell's Two Hearted](http://www.bellsbeer.com/beer/year-round/two-hearted-ale){:target="_blank"} if in the East or Midwest. Alternatively, a nice Kombucha or green tea would be excellent as well.

2. Put on something soothing, maybe some [Satie](https://youtu.be/_fuIMye31Gw){:target="_blank"}. 

3. Start with rbenv, and good luck. 

{:.alert .alert-info}
The official [Jekyll install on mac docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/) can also lead you through ways of installing Ruby, but the below are currently more accurate and detailed.

Frustratingly, different versions of Ruby have many dependency and incompatibility problems. We've detailed two different ways to install and manage versions on the Mac below. This is necessary, because most Macs come with an older version of Ruby already installed on the OS, but Jekyll and other applications require newer versions to work correctly. 

- Your first step is to check what version your Mac has installed by default. Enter `ruby -v` into your terminal (which you can open by clicking `Command (⌘) + Spacebar`, typing `terminal`, and pressing `Enter`). 
- If the Ruby Version is > 2.4.0 you can use the system Ruby, but recommended practice is to set up a separate Ruby development environment. To do this, follow the instructions below, which outline the steps to install Ruby using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv){:target="_blank"}. Alternatively, some people have success using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/){:target="_blank"} (`brew install ruby`) or another manager such as [rvm](https://rvm.io){:target="_blank"}, but our experience suggests rbenv is currently the best option.

## Get the Xcode Command Line Tools First
- Ensure you have Xcode Command Line Tools, so that you can work with Ruby (and Git, etc.)
- To do this, open your terminal by clicking `Command (⌘) + Spacebar`, typing `terminal` into the spotlight box that appears, and pressing `Enter`
- Type `xcode-select --install` into the terminal window and press `Enter` to start the installer. Note: this may take some time to install.
 
## Using rbenv to Install Ruby

- You'll need to use homebrew to install rbenv. You can go to the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/){:target="_blank"} site and follow their instructions, or follow along below
    - Open your terminal by clicking `Command (⌘) + Spacebar`, typing `terminal` into the spotlight box that appears, and pressing `Enter`
    - Once inside your terminal, copy the script in the box underneath "Install Homebrew" on the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/){:target="_blank"} webpage. Paste this script you just copied into the terminal prompt and press `Enter`. 
    - You'll then be prompted to press `Enter` once more to continue the install:

{:.text-center}
{% include bootstrap/image.md img="/ruby/mac/brew1.png" class="border border-dark w-75" %}

- When the script finishes installing, your terminal screen will look something like this:

{:.text-center}
{% include bootstrap/image.md img="/ruby/mac/brew2.png" class="border border-dark w-75" %}

- Next, copy and paste the command `brew install rbenv` into your terminal prompt and press `Enter`. This installation might take a while:

{:.text-center}
{% include bootstrap/image.md img="/ruby/mac/brewinstall.png" class="border border-dark w-75" %}

- Once rbenv has been installed, copy and paste `rbenv init` into the terminal prompt and press `Enter`. This installation is a short one. Your screen should look like this when it's finished:

{:.text-center}
{% include bootstrap/image.md img="/ruby/mac/rbenvinit.png" class="border border-dark w-75" %}

- The program is asking you to edit your bash profile so that this setting is constant from now on. The terminal should have a message similar to the following:

{:.text-center}
{% include bootstrap/image.md img="/ruby/mac/rbenvbashprofile.png" class="border border-dark w-75" %}

To edit your bash profile, follow the instructions below: 
- Open your bash profile with the terminal's text editor, nano, by copying and pasting  `nano ~/.bash_profile` into the terminal prompt and pressing `Enter`. 
- Your terminal should switch to a nano text editor screen that includes a path to .bash_profile at the top. Below is an example of what a bash profile can look like, but note that this profile's contents will probably look different from yours and that's okay:

{:.text-center}
{% include bootstrap/image.md img="/ruby/mac/bash1.png" class="border border-dark w-75" %}

- Use the down arrow on your keyboard to move to the end of the text file.
- Paste `eval "$(rbenv init -)"` at the end of the profile's text:

{:.text-center}
{% include bootstrap/image.md img="/ruby/mac/bash2.png" class="border border-dark w-75" %}

- Press `Control` + `x` to exit and save the profile. You'll see a message at the bottom of your screen asking whether you want to save the profile:

{:.text-center}
{% include bootstrap/image.md img="/ruby/mac/bash3.png" class="border border-dark w-75" %}

- Press the `y` key on your keyboard to specify yes. The bottom of your screen will then look like this:

{:.text-center}
{% include bootstrap/image.md img="/ruby/mac/bash4.png" class="border border-dark w-75" %}

- Press `Enter` to finish saving the file and exit nano.

### Install Ruby

- Now you're ready to install Ruby!
    - Install the latest version of ruby by copy/pasting or writing, `rbenv install 2.7.0`  (2.7.0 is the latest solid version as of this writing; if you are reading this past August 2020, you may need to check the "Stable Releases" section on [the download Ruby page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/){:target="_blank"}) and install the latest release.
    - Now let's set that version as your global Ruby version by entering `rbenv global 2.7.0` into the terminal prompt and pressing `Enter`. 
    - Finally, we're going to rehash, just to be safe: copy and paste the command `rbenv rehash` into your prompt and pressing `Enter`.
- Now let's see if that worked. 
    - Quit your terminal by right clicking (`Control + click`) its icon in your applications menu, and selecting `Quit` from the options that appear.
    - Then reopen your terminal by clicking `Command (⌘) + Spacebar`, typing `terminal` into the spotlight box that appears, and pressing `Enter`
    - Enter `ruby -v` into the terminal prompt, and press `Enter`:

{:.text-center}
{% include bootstrap/image.md img="/ruby/mac/rubyv.png" class="border border-dark w-75" %}

- If your terminal indicates that you have Ruby 2.7.0 or higher installed, you've done it!

{:.text-success}
Your computer should be using ruby version 2.7.0 now. 

If the installation did not work, you might try using RVM following the steps below or googling any error message or other hinderance you encountered.

## Using RVM to Install Ruby
 - Install [Ruby Version Manager (RVM)](https://rvm.io/){:target="_blank"} following the steps below:
    - Install gpg2, using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/){:target="_blank"}: `brew install gnupg`
    - Get the public key from [https://rvm.io/rvm/install](https://rvm.io/rvm/install){:target="_blank"}: `gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB`
    - Get the helper script and install RVM stable with ruby: `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby`

{:.alert .alert-warning}
We have had a lot of issues recently with the public key from gpg not working. Installations on several computers have been held up at this step. This is why we are currently recommending you use rbenv (above) instead.

- Install recent stable version of Ruby:
    - Check [Ruby Downloads](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/){:target="_blank"} for number of "current stable version", currently 2.6.4
    - Use RVM to install that version: `rvm install 2.6.4` (this may take a long time...)
    - Set it as default Ruby: `rvm --default use 2.6.4`
    - Check: `ruby -v`
