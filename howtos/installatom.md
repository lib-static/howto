title: How To Install and Setup Atom 
---
Atom is an open source text editor, which will help you develop your Collection Builder template. 

In the past, people have moved toward using Visual Studio Code rather than Atom. This is because, in the quest to achieve optimal functionality, Atom felt unnecessarily complex; however, Visual Studio Code has made many of the same movements toward increasing functionality, and in the process has aligned itself next to Atom in terms of usability. 

So let's give Atom another shot! It fulfills all of the needs of a text editor, and some people think it beats out Visual Studio Code. 

### Step 1: Download Atom 

- Navigate to [Atom's website](https://atom.io){:target="_blank"} 
- Select "Download"

The website should automatically detect which operating system you're using (Windows, IOS, Linux).

- Once the download is complete, select and open the downloaded file

- If prompted, follow on-screen instructions such as "click yes, the program is safe" or "are you sure you want to open it"

### Step 2: Start coding or customize 

Once installation is complete, you can:
- Click around and start coding
- Begin customizing Atom

There are also options to learn quick key combinations that will make your experience much more efficient. You can choose themes, if you are an aesthetically driven person, or if it just makes more sense for you visually to manipulate the program a bit.

### Step 3: Install a package on Atom (optional)

You may want to install an optional package on Atom to help increase the usability. 

To do so:

- Select the "Install a Package" button under the "Get to Know Atom" window

{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="/atom/know.atom.install.png" caption="Atom homepage" alt="screen shot of the Atom homepage with the install button" class="w-50" %}

- Then select the "Open Installer" button

{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="/atom/open.search.png" caption="Install a package window" alt="screen shot of the open installer" class="w-50" %}

- In the search bar, enter the name of packages you wish to install or search options Atom suggests

One helpful package is "Rainbow-CSV", which will color-coat your text and help you segregate lines and various pieces of code. 

- Type the name of the package into the search bar

- Then select "Install"
