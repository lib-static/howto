# Installing Atom 

Atom is an open source text editor, which will help you develop your Collection Builder template. In the past, people have moved toward using Visual Studio Code rather than Atom. This is because, in the quest to achieve optimal functionality, Atom felt unnecessarily complex; however, Visual Studio Code has made many of the same movements toward increasing functionality, and in the process has aligned itself next to Atom in terms of usability. So let's give Atom another shot! It fulfills all of the needs of a text editor, and some people think   it beats out Visual Studio Code. 

## Step 1 

- Go to [Atom's website](https://atom.io){:target="_blank"} and press download (the website should automatically detect what OS you utilize).

- The website will drop you a download file. Click on it.

- Your computer may ask you a question like this; click yes, the program is safe.

## Step 2 

- You will be shown a screen like this. Click around and start coding, or you can begin customizing Atom. There are also options to learn quick key combinations that will make your experience much more efficient. You can choose themes, if you are an aesthetically driven person, or if it just makes more sense for you visually to manipulate the program a bit.

## Step 3 (optional)

- You may want to install a package on Atom. Packages help increase the useability. 
- You're going to want to click on the "Install a Package" button, under the "Get to Know Atom" window.

- A search bar will open and you will have the ability to enter the name of packages you wish to install, or search options Atom suggests.

- One helpful package is Rainbow-CSV. This will color-coat your text and help you segregate lines and various pieces of code. You will simply type the name of the package into the search bar, and then you will click install.
